# Modern Homepage

This workspace contains a single-page, responsive landing page implementation.

Files added or updated:

- `home.html` — the HTML page.
- `styles.css` — responsive, accessible styles with a modern look.
- `script.js` — small JS for mobile nav, theme preference, demo form behavior.

To view the page, open `home.html` in your browser.

Tip: tweak CSS variables in `styles.css` to change color palette, radius, or spacing.
